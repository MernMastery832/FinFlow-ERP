### **My Contributions**  
As a Full Stack (MERN) developer, I played a key role in building and optimizing both the frontend and backend of the system. On the frontend, I developed interactive and responsive UI components using React while implementing Redux for efficient state management. On the backend, I designed and optimized RESTful APIs using Node.js and Express, ensuring seamless data flow and integration. I worked extensively on MongoDB, structuring schemas for performance and scalability. Additionally, I integrated JWT-based authentication with role-based access control to enhance security. I also contributed to deployment by configuring Docker containers, making the application scalable and easy to maintain. Throughout the project, I collaborated closely with the team, refining system functionalities and ensuring a smooth user experience.
